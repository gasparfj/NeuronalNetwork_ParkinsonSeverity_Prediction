# NeuronalNetwork_ParkinsonSeverity_Prediction
This project analyzes the parkinsons_updrs.data dataset, scales biomedical voice features, and builds two deep neural networks to predict Parkinson’s severity: one with two hidden layers of 10 nodes each, and another with three hidden layers of 10, 20, and 10 nodes. Their performance is compared using ROC curves and multiple evaluation metrics.
